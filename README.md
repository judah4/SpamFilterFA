# SpamFilterFA
cs 421 Programming assignment 1.

Task: Suppose you want to use pattern matching to identify email messages that are spam email given a collection of emails.  
Specifications: Your programming assignment is to design and implement an FA that accepts strings such as “free access”, “free software”, “free vacation”, “free trials”, and “win/winner(s)”. These strings must be in the body of the message not the subject.  Thus, the language to be accepted by your automaton is as follows. 
L = { w = “free access”, w = “free software”,  
      w = “free vacation”, w = “free trials”, w = “win”,  
      w = “winner”, w = “winners”, w = “winnings”}
